If you think that machine learning is the cure-all remedy and you sell it as such, you are doing it wrong. 
The best way to jeopardize your business is to go all in with machine learning following the 5 tips below. 

The attentive reader will now realize this blog post hides an advertisement about a great job opportunity at Innodata Labs! 
Majority already stop reading at this point and are quickly scanning through the 5 tips and will bounce within 10 seconds. 
Here's [the link to follow](https://www.workable.com/j/4E2308F924) to read about the very unique person we are searching for. 

I remember a few year ago, while in the [Lead to Win](http://www.leadtowin.ca/) program, we would refer to this persona 
as 'mutants'. That's exactly what we are looking for: an AI expert with entrepreneurial spirit who just can't let coding work go.

# So, how to missell machine learning?

## Tip #1: Machine learning is the cure-all remedy, forget about everything else.

Well, do not fire the non-machine learing developpers right away. The truth is that the vast majority of software development is still and will remain conventionnal development and engineering.

## Tip #2: Make sure to market off-the-shelf AI solutions, batteries included.

There is a growing skeptisim toward [machine learning as a service](http://www.bradfordcross.com/blog/2017/3/3/five-ai-startup-predictions-for-2017) (MLaaS). And knowing that the powerhouse of ML algorithms is data... batteries are rarely included. 

Data has to be harvested, built, cleaned and collected in 1st party databases or using [reciprocal applications](http://www.rightrelevance.com/search/articles/hero?article=ad608ec74c0a09cc6088810356ad2b8264994d53&query=Machine%20Learning&taccount=ml_toparticles). That's the main obstacle to MLaaS.

## Tip #3: Remember that latest Machine Learning techniques will solve the toughest problems.

As Andrew Ng [states it](https://hbr.org/2016/11/what-artificial-intelligence-can-and-cant-do-right-now), "If a typical person can do a mental task with less than one second of thought, we can probably automate it using AI either now or in the near future."

No, this does not applies well to all cognitive tasks. 

## Tip #4: You need a Machine Learning program for your company to survive.

You need a data strategy first and foremost. In the absence of time, resources or skills to tame the ML beast, 
invest in understanding and managing your data wealth. 

You can probably start with low cost [data lakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake) or just with simple governance rules. Very simple changes in the way you collect, manipulate and store data will unlock extraordinary potential.

## Tip #5: Automate your workflow as is. Machine learning in, people out.

When technology replaces human, it usually comes with major change in workflow, habits roles and tasks. When [the alarm-clock replaced the "knocker-uppers"](https://ines.io/blog/wired-brain-ai-powered-future), waking up in the morning became a whole new experience.

Automating your workflow 'as is' isn't a bad idea - it can act as a bridge between paradigms. However, selling and implementing ML requires a whole new approach to how we work. A good example is how 'bug fixing' needs to transition from coder fixing if-then-else rules to experts fixing the underlying training data.
